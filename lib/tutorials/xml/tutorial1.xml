  <h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
  <summary>
    Machine learning is a burgeoning new technology for mining knowledge from
    data, a technology that a lot of people are starting to take seriously.
    But what is it all about? This tutorial will introduce some fundamental 
    terms in machine learning with some toy exmaples.

    <h2>Data mining and machine learning</h2>
    <p>
      We are overwhelmed with data. There is a growing gap between the <em>
      generation</em> of data and our <em>understanding</em> of it. Data mining 
      is the process of discovering patterns in data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many techniques for finding and describing structural patterns in data are
      developed within the field known at <em>machine learning</em>.

      Describing structural patterns
    </h2>
    <p>
      What is meant by <em>structural pattern?</em> How do you describe them? 
      And what form does the input take? We will answer these questions by way 
      of illustration rather than by attempting formal, and ultimately sterile,
      definitions.
